# chef_test_4

First of all I've installed packer by https://www.packer.io/downloads.html
Than I've get to Microsoft site to get newest iso of Windows Server 2012R2.
In this task I've used mwrock's repo https://github.com/mwrock/packer-templates
Here I've changed path to my iso https://github.com/DZUBA/chef_test_4/blob/master/vbox-2012r2.json#L96
To decline Windows updates I've commented this line https://github.com/DZUBA/chef_test_4/blob/master/scripts/package.ps1#L8
Build process starts with command
```
packer build -only virtualbox-iso .\vbox-2012r2.json
```
